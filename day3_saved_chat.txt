19:36:47 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : no zoom
19:36:50 From David Roessli to Everyone : No
19:41:48 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : This happened to me while doing the homework
19:41:53 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : hmmm
19:42:19 From Annika Brinkmann to Everyone : Runtime?
19:42:36 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Does it cause a loop?
19:42:37 From Agnieszka Pi≈Çasiewicz to Everyone : defined after used
19:43:39 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : After the css is being applied‚Ä¶
19:43:40 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Is the ‚Äûcascade‚Äú of relevance here? So local vs "global"?
19:44:11 From David Roessli to Everyone : Specificity?
19:45:32 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Again, please
19:45:33 From John Williams to Everyone : I feel like I almost got it
19:46:20 From Lea Verou to Everyone : So, we need to redefine ‚Äîsecondary-color inside the ‚Äúarticle a‚Äù declaration?
19:47:02 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : oO
19:47:09 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Hahahah whaaat
19:47:17 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : curious
19:47:35 From David Roessli to Everyone : Hahaha
19:47:36 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : LOL
19:47:41 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : This is awesome
19:47:57 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : And just because of your name he got the correct answer
19:55:35 From Lea Verou to Everyone : https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/KKWZJev?editors=1100
19:58:42 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : I‚Äôm kinda lost
20:02:23 From Dennis McGhee to Everyone : What do you think of doing a ‚Äîlightness-scale like we did for font-size earlier?
20:04:37 From Willa Jarnagin to Everyone : When using color ranges, do you worry about inadvertently dropping below the color contrast required for accessibility?
20:06:15 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : ‚Äîl-80: 30% kinda feels like using ‚Äîcolor-red: blue ‚Ä¶
20:10:00 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : I like using some kind of ‚Äûpresets‚Äú ‚Äì like the lighter/darker, as it‚Äôs easier to work on in a team to keep things consistent üëç
20:11:06 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Is HSL 100% compatible with RGB?? As in: we can convert any RGB color to HSL?
20:11:47 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Thinking of how exact one could reproduce ‚Äûbrand colors‚Äú etc. in HSL
20:12:28 From Geoff to Everyone : https://convertacolor.com/
20:13:42 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Is there an alpha option in hsl? 
20:13:43 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : I see, it converts them to float numbers, such as hsl(13.4,81.7%,59.2%) ‚Äì sexy :)
20:13:48 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : Me too, probably because I started out as a print designer, so even if it‚Äôs mixing light, it makes sense to me
20:14:21 From Mary Ditchen to Everyone : https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/hsl/
20:14:57 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Thanks Mary
20:14:59 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : Thanks for the reference of HSL!
20:15:11 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : Also because I did color photography in a dark room
20:15:11 From Mary Ditchen to Everyone : Once you can visualize the different points of the HSL color wheel, it gets a lot more intuitive. :)
20:17:49 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : that‚Äôs interesting
20:17:51 From Nao Suzuki to Everyone : Question:
When do we use lch() in css setting?
I think that hsl() meets in many case‚Ä¶
20:18:50 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Whoah this is powerful
20:19:57 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : This is great, can‚Äôt wait.
20:20:10 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : Can we do a break?
20:20:34 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : How long do you think this would take for all browsers to catch up? :)
20:20:44 From Geoff to Everyone : If you start with an RGB value and modify that value with one of the others, are you still stuck in the RGB gamut or does it go beyond?
20:21:13 From Dennis McGhee to Everyone : I want color-mix yesterday
20:31:44 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : yes
20:32:13 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : I remember
20:35:29 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : @property scale
20:46:22 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : that's so cool!!!!!!!!!!

20:52:28 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : I not so quick
20:55:40 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : They‚Äôre up anyways due to zoom
20:55:41 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : ^^^
20:59:56 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : I've read recommendations to try to only animate transforms or opacity because of performance and repaint. Do vars affect that? ü§î
21:00:48 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/gpu-animation-doing-it-right/ (just if it helps)
21:03:07 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : This is genius
21:04:25 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : üåà
21:04:35 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : WOW! 
21:07:48 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : set 10 as default
21:08:14 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Or we could make it repeat the pattern with ‚Äû2n‚Äú etc

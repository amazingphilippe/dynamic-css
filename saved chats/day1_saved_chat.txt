20:11:02 From Annika Brinkmann to Everyone : last?
20:11:03 From Peter Uy to Everyone : none
20:11:04 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Is that valid CSS?
20:11:06 From Beth Lei to Everyone : yellowgreen
20:11:15 From Sanne to Everyone : yellowgreen
20:11:15 From Fabrizio Palladino to Everyone : none
20:11:17 From Agnieszka PiÅ‚asiewicz to Everyone : yellowgreen
20:11:18 From Joscha Probst to Everyone : yellowgreen since none is invalid for background

20:12:31 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : ðŸ¤¯
20:12:53 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : If it is a property that doesnâ€™t use commas it would be invalid CSS?
20:12:55 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : Oh god
20:16:27 From Daniel MartÃ­nez to Everyone : I was thinking exactly that! That's a shorthand.
20:16:47 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Thanks!
20:17:13 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : not i
20:18:38 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : kinda
20:18:42 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Yas!

20:23:52 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Everyone : set the default color var
20:23:53 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Save it to another var
20:23:56 From Sanne to Everyone : Color = var
20:23:58 From Nathanael Beisiegel to Everyone : --default-color
20:24:00 From Beth Lei to Everyone : use another css var
20:24:03 From Sanne to Everyone : Than currentcolor
20:24:14 From Tunji Akanbi to Everyone : Aa fallback variable
20:27:32 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : Is there a performance hit with the number of vars?
20:32:14 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : [â€”intensity=1] etc.?
20:32:15 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : multiple --intensity inside hsl?
20:32:29 From Annika Brinkmann to Everyone : / .x in hsl?
20:35:43 From Annika Brinkmann to Everyone : Can you somehow use clam?
20:36:21 From Christiane Helmchen to Everyone : 15
20:37:01 From Sanne to Everyone : 200 - 50 instead of 200 + 50
20:37:42 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : make the hsl be the var
20:39:29 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : I meant that ðŸ˜…
20:40:49 From Oscar Pagani to Everyone : Can we have a break?
20:43:34 From Tunji Akanbi to Everyone : Sounds good
20:44:05 From Tunji Akanbi to Everyone : Are your examples available online?
20:45:02 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Lea Verou(Direct Message) : This is really awesome Lea. I wish I understood more!
20:45:20 From Lea Verou to Everyone : @Tunji: The start state or the end state? The start state yes, the end state Iâ€™m afraid not, it would only be in the recording. I could post them after the workshop though!
20:46:20 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Lea Verou(Direct Message) : I should have specified, I donâ€™t understand more, because I know next to nothing about CSS.
20:52:40 From Lea Verou to Jan Constantin - Smashing Team(Direct Message) : Thank you, though in that case how can you tell if itâ€™s awesome? :P
20:52:58 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Lea Verou(Direct Message) : From my little Java programming experience
20:53:07 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Lea Verou(Direct Message) : It all makes sense
20:53:17 From Lea Verou to Jan Constantin - Smashing Team(Direct Message) : :)
20:55:11 From John Williams to Everyone : I expect to spend a lot of time practicing
20:55:27 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll have a lot when I actually write code

21:17:25 From Oscar Pagani to Everyone : Can you explain what happens at parse time and what at computed time
21:17:31 From Zachary Geier to Everyone : you have to click the right arrow to get to the next slides with the link

21:17:37 From Yannick Schall to Everyone : Did you mention a slack channel?
21:17:38 From Tunji Akanbi to Everyone : thanks
21:18:02 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Thanks @Jan
21:18:56 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Everyone : Hi Yannick yes there is a slack channel for the workshop: https://join.slack.com/t/smashingworkshops/shared_invite/zt-o07y8b34-ra4P~u2TUvpcqJTKmUuJaA
(#dynamic-css)
21:22:40 From Beth Lei to Everyone : what the recommended css unit, px or rem?
21:22:56 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Do you use something in particular to split the CSS files?
21:23:02 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Would you recommend using :root over other â€žglobalâ€œ spaces to store css variables (such as the * {} selector?
21:24:58 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : It will be bad idea for images, for example
21:26:16 From Beth Lei to Everyone : if we don't need to use IE11, do you recommend using converting sass vars (current codebase) to css vars? perhaps still keep sass vars for mixins?
21:26:17 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Oh thanks for the clarification, the SVG argument is a good hint :)
21:28:28 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Where can I find browser support for the `lch` function? I couldnâ€™t find it in caniuse
21:28:44 From Beth Lei to Everyone : thanks for the clarifications on sass/css vars
21:29:20 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Amazing! Thanks!
21:29:52 From Lea Verou to Everyone : color(display-p3 1 0 0)
21:31:12 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : I want to use those colors!

21:31:35 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : I want to use them too, I love color :D
21:31:38 From Daniel GonzÃ¡lez to Everyone : Thanks!
21:32:05 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Can you further specify in which cases it might make sense to use @support for checking css variables support instead of just using the cascade?
21:32:57 From Daniel MartÃ­nez to Everyone : I have to go. My kid's dinner time (He's a couple of month older tan Zoe so, you know how it is ðŸ˜‚ ) As usual: AWESOME workshop. See you tomorrow!
21:33:04 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Ah perfekt, thanks for clarification :)
21:33:14 From Jan Constantin - Smashing Team to Everyone : Bye Daniel! Thanks!
21:33:30 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : I see css vars used in strange ways sometimes and wonder if I can ask what they are doing.
21:33:31 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Thanks for the workshop! You are a legend!

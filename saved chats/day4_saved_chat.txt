19:19:55 From Lea Verou to Everyone : https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/88ba47d1fdc4beda7679f6474ddc78f8?editors=1100
19:28:42 From Marzena to Everyone : 0em
19:28:46 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : No em units
19:31:39 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : sure!
19:31:39 From Eric Kramp to Everyone : Sure!
19:31:41 From Tunji Akanbi VCC to Everyone : yes
19:32:31 From Lea Verou to Everyone : https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/9ba1b5e2fb7fbb320c3ab244df7baf3d?editors=1100
19:34:47 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Is the demo updated? Doesn‚Äôt look like it
19:35:25 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : no, it's not updated
19:39:41 From Eric Kramp to Everyone : Is there an alternate method for browsers that don‚Äôt support @property yet?
19:40:31 From Dmitry Sharabin to Everyone : My fans gone crazy üòÖ
19:47:23 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : Min max formula :)
19:56:23 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : Is there a way to emulate dark mode in firefox?
19:56:38 From Eric Kramp to Everyone : I don‚Äôt see the workshop collection under your profile in codepen
19:57:03 From Eric Kramp to Everyone : Got, thanks!
19:57:15 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Would it make sense to map that calc function to a sass function with a clearer name, something like booleanCheck or something like that?
19:57:18 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Yes, it's possible
19:57:21 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : filter: invert(1)
19:57:22 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : yes there is
19:57:48 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : In FF there is a moon icon in the inspector tab
19:57:57 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : thanks
19:58:01 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : for dark mode
19:58:40 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : I meant just to generate the code, not to evaluate it ü§î
19:59:10 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : My teammates would kill me if they saw that calc as it is
19:59:13 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : :D
19:59:38 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Not readable
19:59:45 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : And they're not experts
19:59:51 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Yeah, agree, not everyone is on the same ‚Äûlevel‚Äú
19:59:53 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : So it would be hard to understand
20:00:03 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : But the technique is awesome!
20:00:45 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : My teammates have never used css vars at all, that's why :)
20:02:03 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : I am planning to do so!! :D
20:02:12 From Lea Verou to Everyone : yay
20:02:13 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : It's evaluating the math?
20:03:59 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Ah you just have to add the ()
20:04:06 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : So the token is read correctly?
20:12:16 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : --base-size and multiple everything
20:12:29 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : No units
20:12:53 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : If you multiple a unitless var
20:13:14 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : Calculate the height in relation to font size
20:14:01 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Use a unitless var and then multiply it with *1em for the pointer height maybe
20:27:48 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Is that or (|) just for strings?
20:28:56 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : cooooooool!!! 
20:29:38 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : none
20:32:13 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Because it‚Äôs not interpreted as string
20:32:23 From David Roessli to Everyone : Needs to be registered as string
20:32:29 From Sarah M√§rdian to Everyone : Quotes are missing
20:32:56 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : The same as the () before?
20:33:12 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : Register it as <number> | <string>? Is that valid?
20:33:28 From Yannick Schall to Everyone : Css counters/
20:35:08 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs happening there with the CSS Counters‚Ä¶ hehehe
20:41:52 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Use calc()?
20:41:53 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : use sass?
20:41:55 From Marc Rinderknecht to Everyone : is there rounding in calc()
20:42:25 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : is there modulo (%) in calc()?
20:46:01 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : wow
20:46:10 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : Crazy
20:49:48 From Lea Verou to Everyone : #play-buttons
20:52:54 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : I know where this I going üòá
20:53:05 From David Roessli to Everyone : Power 2 + sq root
20:55:20 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : Power 2 + sq root could be rewritten as: calc( (var(--p) * var(--p)) / var(--p))
20:55:42 From Lea Verou to Everyone : p * p / p = p
20:56:00 From Lea Verou to Everyone : max(p, -p)
20:57:07 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : yes, clever
20:58:42 From Marc Rinderknecht to Everyone : translateY
20:59:07 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : To the bar
20:59:14 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : oh
21:01:28 From Sanne 't Hooft to Everyone : Column-reverse
21:05:08 From Sarah M√§rdian to Everyone : calc(--p / --p-abs)
21:05:41 From Sarah M√§rdian to Everyone : forgot the var() :)
21:07:38 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : My brain hurts
21:07:48 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : Yap, now it makes sense
21:08:28 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : ok, I see :)
21:08:30 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : *silently nodding*
21:08:43 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : ‚Äîis-positive: max(var(‚Äîp-sign), 0)
21:08:47 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : Would work as well, right?
21:11:36 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : order
21:12:17 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : I can't hear anything, is it just me?
21:12:47 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : I can hear
21:12:53 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Sorry, I'm back
21:13:12 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Weird issue at my side, I guess
21:13:23 From Dennis McGhee to Everyone : `flex: column nowrap; flex-direction: var(‚Äîtoggle, column-reverse);` might work but not very pretty
21:14:47 From Sanne 't Hooft to Everyone : images
21:14:50 From Dan Poynor to Everyone : imgs!
21:14:51 From Beth Lei to Everyone : images
21:14:51 From Sarah M√§rdian to Everyone : images

21:16:48 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : Ok, thanks!
21:17:35 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : tokens?
21:17:47 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : Url is func
21:17:55 From Carlos Morales to Everyone : you said the url function was different :D
21:21:07 From Dmitry Sharabin to Everyone : Won‚Äôt @property with syntax: ‚Äú<url>‚Äù solve the problem?
21:24:32 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : a
21:24:37 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : a.css
21:24:45 From Dmitry Sharabin to Everyone : Depending on the order?
21:24:48 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : b
21:24:54 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : a
21:24:57 From Dennis McGhee to Everyone : b
21:25:03 From Beth Lei to Everyone : b
21:25:05 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : B urls are relative to css
21:26:41 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : different things
21:26:55 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : otherwise we would not talk about it ;-)
21:26:56 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : As it is now registers, it resolves on a.css?
21:27:02 From Dmitry Sharabin to Everyone : A (since it doesn‚Äôt inherit)
21:27:05 From Dimitris Grammatikogiannis to Everyone : B again
21:27:08 From Matilde Rosero to Everyone : A
21:27:18 From Moritz Stoltenburg to Everyone : a
21:28:24 From Daniel Gonz√°lez to Everyone : At the moment @property is only working on Chrome, and Edge. Right?
21:30:20 From Lea Verou to Everyone : #play-buttons
21:30:32 From Tunji Akanbi VCC to Everyone : Will the slides be updated to reflect the take aways after each section?
21:30:49 From Philipp Sterker to Everyone : I will nobdy ever tell me again ‚ÄûCSS is easy, it‚Äôs not real programming‚Äú üòÇ
21:30:50 From Tunji Akanbi VCC to Everyone : thanks
